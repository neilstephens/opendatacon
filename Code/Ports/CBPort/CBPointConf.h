// Also I have concerns about blocking checks on futures, which would block one of the asio threads - we may only have 4!
// This guys has some answers:
// http://code-slim-jim.blogspot.com/2014/07/async-usage-of-futures-and-promises-in.html
// So here is how you use std::promise and std::future in lambdas, binds, asio and anything else u cant move into.
// I also tossed in an example of how to use non-blocking checks on the futures which is another key tool for using futures in asio code.
// Apparently you can just call IOsvc.run() to yield the thread. It will come back when it has nothing to do.
